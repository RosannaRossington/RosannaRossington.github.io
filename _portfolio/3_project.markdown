A Ruby on Rails application that uses the Devise gem to setup an authentication process to register, login and log out users (creating and destroying sessions). Created a PostgreSQL database performing SQL queries, to list and register users, create recommendations and add comments. Managed the creation of tables and alterations using migrations to add functionality such as user profile images and comments to recommendation feeds. The Carrierwave gem allows users to upload a profile picture, with a default image loaded if the user chooses not to, and style pictures in the feed too. The main functionality is due to the Gastly gem that takes screenshots of web pages using built-in Phantom.js and MiniMagick to scrape the inputted URL. The application customises templates from Foundation styled using SCSS and SASS with JavaScript and jQuery to add style features too.


<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col two" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/6.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/11.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
