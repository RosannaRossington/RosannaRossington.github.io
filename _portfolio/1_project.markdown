Functionality

A four level brain test game. On click the user is shown two buttons that each contain a colour. The user has to click the colour of the text not the text. Each level displays the round for between two and a half â€“ three seconds. The user's score is displayed after ten rounds and logs if the user is correct, incorrect or not fast enough. Introducing added distraction to level three and an additional background colour in level four.

Technologies

A single page JavaScript application using jQuery methods to hide and show HTML elements depending on the users input. The library also allows the execution of a new round after a set interval depending on the level, the three HTML elements per round are created using a random generator function. Animate CSS adds styling and distractions to the game in level 3 and a counter loop keeps score and limits the levels to ten rounds.
