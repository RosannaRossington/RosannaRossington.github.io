  <p>General Assembly is a three-month, full time course covering the fundamentals of front and back end programming to cutting-edge libraries and frameworks, using technologies such as Node.js, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript and AngularJS. The Web Development Immersive course appealed to me as it  gave me the opportunity to approach my new career in a methodical way; I built on my skills and knowledge in a structure that mirrored the history of the web. It has given me a fountain of <a class="link-1" href="/technologies/">knowledge</a> that I look forward to using and learning more about. I am also familiar with the agile development method; participating in daily stand-ups and regularly pair programming throughout the course too.</p>
