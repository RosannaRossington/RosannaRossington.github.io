    <p>Project 1 – What colour is the text? A single page JavaScript game application to keep your mind sharp. An individual four-day project that tests the brain using colours and distractions to force you to think hard in a limited time period before you
        give your answer. https://what-colour.herokuapp.com/ https://github.com/RosannaRossington/wdi-project-1 Functionality: A four level brain test game. On click the user is shown two buttons that each contain a colour. The user has to click the colour
        of the text not the text. Each level displays the round for between two and a half – three seconds. The user's score is displayed after ten rounds and logs if the user is correct, incorrect or not fast enough. Introducing added distraction to
        level three and an additional background colour in level four. Technologies used: A single page JavaScript application using jQuery methods to hide and show HTML elements depending on the users input. The library also allows the execution of a
        new round after a set interval depending on the level, the three HTML elements per round are created using a random generator function. Animate CSS adds styling and distractions to the game in level 3 and a counter loop keeps score and limits
        the levels to ten rounds.</p>

      A Rails application with PostgreSQL that brings a social aspect to shopping online.
An individual five-day project that allows you to share links to products you think would suit a friend.

 https://github.com/RosannaRossington/wdi-project-2
 https://the-mudita.herokuapp.com/

Functionality: See something that would look great on a friend. Find a username paste in a product page URL. Send and check your Inbox too to see what recommendations you have and upload a picture wearing your new purchase.

Technologies used: A Ruby on Rails application that uses the Devise gem to setup an authentication process to register, login and log out users (creating and destroying sessions). Created a PostgreSQL database performing SQL queries, to list and register users, create recommendations and add comments. Managed the creation of tables and alterations using migrations to add functionality such as user profile images and comments to recommendation feeds. The Carrierwave gem allows users to upload a profile picture, with a default image loaded if the user chooses not to, and style pictures in the feed too. The main functionality is due to the Gastly gem that takes screenshots of web pages using built-in Phantom.js and MiniMagick to scrape the inputted URL. The application customises templates from Foundation styled using SCSS and SASS with JavaScript and jQuery to add style features too.

      A MEN stack application that aims to display data from the Police API in an easily accessible and visually appealing manner.
A three person six-day group project to raise awareness of the type of crime, location and status of the criminal activity in London.

 https://github.com/RosannaRossington/wdi-project-3
 https://london-vice.herokuapp.com/

 Functionality: Register. Log In. Use the crime selection filter to see icons appear across London. A visually accessible representation of crimes and prison locations. A slide out dashboard provides detailed crime information, street view and stats about crimes in the area. Select a prison and a route will map a journey from the crime to the prison.
 Technologies used: Built on a MEN stack JavaScript framework using Bower LondonVice uses JWT Authentication supported by Passport.io to ensure users are saved securely in the database. This application makes a Jake request to the London PoliceAPI about crimes that took place in February 2015 and loops through to display every five hundredth crime on the map of London. On click of each crime icon a slide out dashboard provides extra information. Set up using the Google Map API this enables the application to include StreetView and by utilising the API’s Direction Service and Geometry Library libraries the user can see a route from crime to prison too. Highcharts was used to set up interactive charts to visually represent crimes in a specific radius of the selected crime. LondonVice uses Snazzy Maps and customises Bootstrap templates using CSS and icons from Noun Project.

      An AngularJS application with an Express backend using Nike’s MSI database.

An independent six-day project to raise awareness regarding the environmental impact of materials used in products on Net-a-Porter.com.

 https://github.com/RosannaRossington/wdi-project-4

Functionality: Browse Net-a-Porter.com. Register. Log In. Copy and paste the product page URL into Providence and see what material the product is made from and the sustainability score in four key areas of those materials.

Technologies used: Using Bower and Grunt the application is set up using Passport authentication strategy  and JWT tokens.  A Jake request is set up to request specific fields for each material saved in the MSI database. On input the application scrapes the product page of the URL using Cheerio and pulls the information that is saved on the same line as %, the data is “cleaned” and then cross-referenced using Regex to return the sustainability score for the materials used to produce the product.
