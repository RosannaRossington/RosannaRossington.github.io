    <p>General Assembly is a three-month, full time course covering the fundamentals of front and back end programming to cutting-edge libraries and frameworks, using technologies such as Node.js, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript and AngularJS. </p>
    <p>The Web Development Immersive course appealed to me as it  gave me the opportunity to approach my new career in a methodical way; I built on my skills and knowledge in a structure that mirrored the history of the web. It has given me a fountain of <a class="link-1" href="/technologies/">knowledge</a> that I look forward to using and improving. As well as familiarity with the agile development method; participating in daily stand-ups and regularly pair programming throughout the course too.</p>
